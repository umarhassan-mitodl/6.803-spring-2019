These notes contain my personal suggestions for style improvement (suggestions = commandments for 6.803 assignments). These suggestions overlap considerably with the suggestions offered in a terrific book written by Lyn Dupr√©, my developmental editor during my book-writing phase. The title of the book, _BUGS in Writing_, suggests that the text is for computer scientists and engineers, but I recommend it for all people who write technical material.

Use of Quotations
-----------------

Use quotations to support your conclusions, rather than to tell your story. After all, it is your thoughts about which the reader wants to learn, rather than those of the quoted person.

Quote supports your conclusion:

Patrick seems to be deeply attracted to Saab automobiles: "I've driven Saabs for 20 years," Patrick said.

Quote coopts your story:

Patrick has "driven Saabs for 20 years."

Use of _Trivial_ and _Simple_
-----------------------------

When in doubt, use a dictionary. Random House says this:

_Trivial_: of very little importance or value  
_Simple_: easy to understand  
Simple ideas are often presumed, incorrectly, to be trivial.

Use of _We_
-----------

_We_ means the author and the reader or the authors. Unless you are a king or queen, or you are one of multiple authors, do not use _we_ when you are referring to yourself. Someone, somewhere, decided it was egotistic to use _I_, but the _we_ prescription can lead to confusion about who is actually responsible for the work.

_Former_ and _Latter_
---------------------

Do not use _the former_ and _the latter_ and related phrases. They force your reader to stop reading, to scan back, and to reread previous material. Use an unambiguous reference instead.

Ugh:

I like fast cars and cold beer. I like the former because ....

Nice:

I like fast cars and cold beer. I like fast cars because ....

_Above_ and _Below_
-------------------

When you refer to another place in your writing, use the most precise pointer possible.

Often vague:

I could have committed the below above.

More precise:

I could have commited the below blunder in the first paragraph of this page.

_Since_ and _Because_
---------------------

_Because_ means that there is a causal connection. _Since_ means that time has passed.

Wrong choice:

He took 6.803 since it is a gut course.

Correct choice:

He took 6.803 because it is a gut course.

Ambiguous:

He has taken gut courses since he decided to go to law school.

_That_ and _Which_
------------------

_That_ introduces phrases that identify referents. Do not use _that_ if the referent is already unambiguous; use _which_ instead. _Which_ adds information. Do not use _which_ to introduce a phrase that is helping to disambiguate a referent.

Provides disambiguation:

Patrick lives on Creepy Street in the house _that_ has a Saab parked in the driveway.

Adds information, house already unambiguous:

Patrick lives on Creepy Street in the third house on the left, _which_ has a Saab parked in the driveway.

Whenever I write a book, I do a query-replace, after everything else is done, to replace all misused _which_ instances. Many authors and editors refer to this process as the which hunt.

When Nothing but Your Maximal Effort is Good Enough
---------------------------------------------------

Hire a developmental editor, or at least a good copy editor, to go over your thesis or book or other great opus. I always do.
