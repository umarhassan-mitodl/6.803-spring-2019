Because Tuesday is Monday this week, there is no written assignment for the Marr paper. You need only prepare yourself for discussion. We recommend you prepare by making a broken glass diagram.

Here is what we will discuss:

You are scheduled to have breakfast with MIT President Rafael Reif. You have heard he is interested in Marr and his legacy. Prepare yourself for the meeting by constructing talking points on what Marr might have included in a final section labeled "Contributions" in his paper.

Remember that a contribution can be a better-framed problem, a problem solution, a methodology, a point of view, a conclusion—anything that plainly constitutes an advancement of knowledge.

Further prepare yourself for your breakfast with Reif by constructing talking points on what you would say should Reif ask the following questions:

*   Reif says: "I understand Marr is critical of AI research. Why?"
*   Reif says: "What do you think Minsky would think of Marr's paper?"
*   Reif says: "What do you think Marr would think of Minsky's paper?"
*   Reif says: "What do you think Marr would think of Watson?"
*   Reif says: "What do you think Marr would think of deep neural nets?"
*   Reif says: "What do you think Noam Chomsky would think of Marr's paper?"
*   Reif says: "What do you think Patrick Winston would think of Marr's paper?"
*   Reif says: "What do you think Marr thought about Winston's arch-learning thesis?"
*   Reif says: "What do you think of Marr's paper?"
